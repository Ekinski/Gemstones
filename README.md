# Gemstones
John has collected various rocks. Each rock has various minerals embeded in it. Each type of mineral is designated by a lowercase letter in the range a-z. There may be multiple occurrences of a mineral in a rock. A mineral is called a gemstone if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks in John's collection.
